// Lookup takes two arguments. The map and the path.
// Maps are stored in ./settings
// Path is the path from the map root to the value that we're wanting to acccess.
// An example of this might be with buttons. We want to access the relevant height of a button. We would access the $sizes map. We would then add the path to the height, and then buttons.

@function lookup($map, $path) {
    $current: $map;
    @each $key in $path {
        $current: map-get($current, $key);
