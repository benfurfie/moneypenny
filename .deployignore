## This file works in a similar fashion to .gitignore, but is specifically for the deployment tool deployHQ. It allows me to commit files to the repo – such as build files – while excluding them from being uploaded to the server.
## I have committed compiled code (CSS and JS) in this build. However, as part of my use of continuous integration, I would normally have the server build the final compiled files there. This prevents issues with conflicts with those compiled files when several developers are working on the same project.
